Brief Introduction About Myself in the file
My name is Musangwa Dickson NAYITURIKI, and I am a dedicated nursing student with a strong passion for healthcare, learning, and personal growth. I am driven by a deep desire to reach the highest level in my academic and professional journey, and I consistently push myself to excel both in the classroom and in practical environments. I believe in discipline, resilience, and the power of continuous improvement.

Beyond academics, I am also a committed basketball player who values teamwork, focus, and perseverance. Sports have shaped my mindset, teaching me leadership, discipline, and the importance of balancing physical and mental strength. My goal is to build a future where I combine my love for healthcare and sports to make a meaningful impact in both fields.
