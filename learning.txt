So far in this course, I've learned how to work with Git and GitHub, including creating repositories, cloning them locally, making changes, committing them, and pushing updates online. I've also learned the importance of version control in real-world projects, how branches help keep work organized, and how pull requests make collaboration easier. These skills are helping me understand how developers manage and track changes in software projects professionally.
